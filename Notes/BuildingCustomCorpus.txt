Feature Analysis :
Which part of the text will be conveying and providing meaning to our model.
Which part, dimension, property of our stuff is conveying meaning.

What Is a Corpus?
Corpora are collections of related documents that contain natural language.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Corpora can be annotated, meaning that the text or documents are labeled
with the correct responses for supervised learning algorithms.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Domain specific corpus are usually the best trained ones. 
And they perform better in the field for the same application than the generalised corpus. 
Number of corpuses are available -> Brown corpus, Wikipedia corpus etc. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The corpuses which are meant for a particular field often perform better because. They are specific the domain. 
Otherwise general corpuses collect data from multiple sources and hence is not accurate for any one field. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A framework for ingestion engine called BALEEN is used for construction of domain specific corpora for applied text analysis. 

We need to build a corpus. for the specific domain that we are targeting. Application specific corpus reader.
